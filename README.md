## Foundational Courses
- **[Advanced Large Language Model Agents](https://llmagents-learning.org/)** — a graduate-level course exploring the design and deployment of LLM-powered agents. Covers LLM foundations and infrastructure, reasoning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration, and various applications. Features guest lectures from leading researchers.
- **[Agentic AI and AI Agents: A Primer for Leaders](https://www.coursera.org/learn/agentic-ai)** — a concise course designed for non-technical executives and product managers who want to learn foundamentals of AI agents. Provides relevant theory and teaches no-code approaches of implementing AI agents using custom GPTs.
- **[Hugging Face's AI Agents Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/)** — a hands-on program designed to guide from foundational agents concepts to deploying autonomous AI agents. Covers agent foundamentals as well as practical implementation using different popular frameworks (smolagents, LlamaIndex, LangGraph). Includes assignments and a final project with building, deploying and evaluating your own agent.
- **[Microsoft's AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners)** — a beginner-friendly but comprehensive open-source course comprising 11 lessons on building AI agents. Covers tool integration, RAG, agentic design patterns, multi-agent systems, deplying in production. Lessons include written materials, code samples and videos. Focused on Microsoft frameworks (Azure AI Agent Service, 
Semantic Kernel, AutoGen).
- **[Multi AI Agent Systems with crewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/)** — a beginner-friendly course teaching how to build and deploy AI agents using CrewAI framework. Covers basic concepts including tools management, memory organization, errors handling, agent cooperation. Introduces a lot of AI agent examples for common business processes.
